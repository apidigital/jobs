Story: Administrator adds a new category

	As an administrator
	I want to create a new category
	So I can add new open positions
	
	Scenario: Admin fills out category field
	
		Given a administrative user
		And a category named 'FooBar'
		And there is no category with this name
	
		When the admin submits a new category name
	
		Then redirect to category path
		And there should be a category with name 'FooBar'
	
	Scenario: Non Admin tries to fill out category 
		Given a non-administrative user
		And a category named 'FooBar'
		
		When the user submits a new category name
		
		Then there should not be a category with the name 'FooBar'
		And Redirect to '/'
